# Breast Cancer Classification

Predicting breast cancer diagnosis (Benign vs Malignant)

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on clinical features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset.

- **Total samples:** 569
- **Number of features:** 30
- **Class distribution:**
  - **Malignant:** 212
  - **Benign:** 357

The dataset is known to be **linearly separable** using all 30 features.

## Feature Descriptions

Each data point contains 30 numeric features that describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.

Examples include:

- **Radius** – Mean distance from center to perimeter points
- **Texture** – Standard deviation of grayscale values
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**
- **Smoothness** – Local variations in radius lengths
- **Compactness** – \((\text{perimeter}^2 / \text{area}) - 1.0\)
- **Concavity** – Severity of concave regions in the contour
- **Concave Points** – Number of concave regions
- **Symmetry**
- **Fractal Dimension** – “Coastline approximation”
